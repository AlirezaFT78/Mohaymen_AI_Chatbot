## âœ… 1. Why use RAG over standard LLM prompting?

RAG enables our system to answer questions based on **custom, up-to-date Persian documents**, rather than relying solely on the LLMâ€™s pretrained knowledge. This is especially important for **low-resource languages like Persian**, where public LLMs often lack detailed or accurate domain-specific data.

By using **FAISS** to retrieve the most relevant document chunks and feeding them to **Gemini via an OpenAI-compatible API**, we ensure that:
- Answers are grounded in **real enterprise data**, improving factual accuracy.
- Hallucinations are reduced.
- The system can be updated easily by changing documents, **without fine-tuning** the LLM.

RAG makes our system **modular and scalable**, while ensuring domain-awareness and language sensitivity.

## âœ… 2. How did you handle latency?

We reduced latency through several targeted optimizations:

- **FAISS index is preloaded** once at startup and held in memory, so there's no embedding or re-indexing on each query.
- **FastAPI is async-native**, using `async def` to handle requests efficiently and in parallel.
- **Chunking is done with overlap and small window sizes**, which helps speed up relevant retrieval.
- **`lru_cache` caching** for duplicate queries helps serve fast, repeated results instantly.

This gives us both **fast interactive responses** and lower API usage overhead.

## âœ… 3. How would you scale this in production?

To scale this solution in a real-world deployment, weâ€™d take the following steps:

- **Horizontal scaling**: FastAPI can be containerized and deployed with multiple replicas behind a **load balancer** using **Docker Swarm or Kubernetes**.
- **FAISS index sharing**: We would use **persistent volumes** (e.g., EFS, S3-FUSE) or move to a **managed vector DB** like Pinecone or Weaviate for distributed retrieval.
- **Telegram bot via webhooks**: Switching from polling to **webhooks** behind HTTPS improves real-time response and reduces polling overhead.
- **Redis-based caching**: Use Redis to cache frequent query-answer pairs, avoiding redundant Gemini API calls and reducing cost.
- **Observability stack**: Integrate **Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki** to add metrics, logs, and alerting.
- **Asynchronous job handling**: For heavy-load scenarios, integrate a queue (e.g., Celery) to offload LLM queries to worker threads.

Together, these changes would make the system **highly available, responsive, and cost-effective** in production.
